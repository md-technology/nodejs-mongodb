This 4x5 negative was exposed with an old lens, a 121mm Schneider Super Angulon. It was a favorite of Ansel Adams. While an excellent optic for its time, it only had single-layer coating and was subject to more flare than modern lenses. In this instance, it created a starburst pattern with rainbow streaks that add greatly to the character of the image.","","146069","jpg","84535, UT","","38.409560030559334","-109.89487234544913","b'0'","#9D593F","b'0'","mesa-arch-canyonlands_65569_990x742.jpg","梅萨拱门，峡谷地","3","57"

然而，古代盛行的四合院是廊院式院落，即院子中轴线为主体建筑，周围为回廊链接，或左右有屋，而非四面建房。 晚唐出现具有廊庑的四合院，逐渐取代了廊院，宋朝以后，廊院逐渐减少，到明清逐渐绝迹。","","3691819","JPG","河南省焦作市博爱县s237","","35.219200404760024","113.08900786207609","b'0'","#403F41","b'0'","NG7A9178.JPG","古院落","3","104"
